**AIM OF AN EDGE DETECTOR:**

The aim of an edge detector is to detect when a signal transitions from one logical state to another, typically from low to high (rising edge) or high to low (falling edge).

Edge detection is a crucial function in digital systems, where it is used to identify specific events or changes in a signal.
